# Advanced AI Portfolio Extension

This extension adds three reproducible portfolio prototypes to Tisa Selma's existing GitHub Pages site:

1. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning - Cooperative Edge QoE Control
2. Federated Learning - Non-IID Multisite FedAvg
3. Deep Reinforcement Learning - Double DQN for Drift-Aware QoE Recovery

The website target is `https://meetmetisa-dev.github.io/tisa.github.io/`.

## Evidence boundary

These are synthetic, executable portfolio prototypes created in August 2026. They are not presented as prior peer-reviewed publications, real-user studies, production deployments, formal privacy guarantees, clinical evidence, or safety-certified systems.

## Integration design

- `app.js` preserves the current reveal and publication-filter behavior, then injects an Advanced AI section into the existing homepage.
- `ai-methods.css` styles the injected homepage section.
- `advanced-ai.html` is a full overview page.
- `projects/` contains complete standalone project pages and research artifacts.
- `.github/workflows/validate-advanced-ai.yml` reruns every prototype on pushes and pull requests.
- `assets/downloads/` contains the user-downloadable ZIP packages.
